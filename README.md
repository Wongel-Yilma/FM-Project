# FM-Project

This repository has jupiternotebook files that are used to automate ANSYS simulation

- It uses a pyMAPDL package to access ANSYS API for MAPDL
- ANSYS must be installed on your local computer before running these scripts.


The scripts cover two major phases of the project:
Phase 01: Analysis of single crack specimen
Phase 02: Analysis of multiple crack specimen

- Both of these phases have automated scripts to run multiple consecutive simulations
